# The-Last-Decade-of-Formula-1

This repository contains the data and code files which I prepared as part of my Statistics Curriculum at UIUC.
The current analysis that I have answers the following questions:

* The fall from grace for Ferrari in the last decade of the sport
* Head to Head Comparison of Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton, two GOAT's of the sport
* A quantitative look into Mercedes Dominance in the Hybrid Era

Please go ahead and take a look at the R-Markdown and resultant HTML Files.


As of now there is only one analysis on this repository. I am planning to add more such analysis in this repository.
